All of this is true. Unfortunately, the “perfect spot” is a moving target, dependent on your mood, the alignment of the stars, what you had for breakfast, and a host of other trivial factors. With so many variables in play, it’s almost impossible for mortals to give a backrub that pushes the dial past “relaxing,” or “gratifying.” Of course, in Heaven, things are a little different. The Angels who man (and woman) the Perfect Spot Cosmic Backrub Tables are equipped with magical goggles that allow them to read the chakras of Chaste SOUL like an open children’s book. With this knowledge, they can easily find a SOUL’s “perfect spot,” and send their minds blissfully hurtling into the cosmos. Then they can do it again. And again. And again.
